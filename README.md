# Capstone_Project_IBM

In this project, we assume that they would like to start a new residential project in Boston, one of the most populous cities in the United States. Assuming I am one of the data scientists in Equity Residential and in-charge of analysing data to choose the best place for a new residential project. The management of the company has two main requirements for selecting a district. The first requirement is the selected district must be safe to protect the resident. The second requirement is the environment of the selecting district needs to be similar to Downtown Boston since the company has had a huge success on the Downtown Boston residential project.

This project aims to choose a potential district in Boston for a new residential project. Therefore, this project will also analyse crime records in Boston in order to enhance new residential project security.
